Week 1
Recruit classmates to form a team and start to discuss the topic of project.
Besides, I create our project repository and build up back-end folder for further development preparation.

After determination of topic of project, I start to discuss with teammates about the user story and project objectives.
Also, I am in charge of the back-end development, hence I start to write the one of the part of proposal (i.e., back-end structure)
